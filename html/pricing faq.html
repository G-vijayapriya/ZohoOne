                    <h4>Flexible-User Pricing</h4>
                    <p>We offer Flexible-User Pricing at ₹4,000 per user per month, or ₹3,500 per user per month with an annual subscription. This means you can buy any number of user licenses; you do not have to purchase licenses for ALL employees.</p>
                    <h4>All Employee Pricing                </h4>
                    <p>We offer the All Employee Pricing at a special price of ₹2,500 per employee per month, or ₹1,250 per employee per month with an annual subscription, provided you purchase licenses for ALL employees in the company.                </p>

                <p>No, it won't. When you upgrade to Zoho One, our system will automatically consolidate your billing, give you the adjusted rate, and provide a single payment date. Please note: To automatically receive adjusted billing, you'll need to first start a trial of Zoho One, add the applications you're currently using, and then upgrade.
